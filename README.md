# Fusion Finance

A decentralized lending and borrowing protocol for users to lend and borrow USDC. A completely trustless environment for both lenders and borrowers, built on top of Ethereum and Ethereum L2 solutions. Lenders supply the protocol with USDC and in return earn interest. A portion of lender’s USDC gets sent to AAVE USDC pool where it collects interest before the user decides to withdraw and the other portion gets sent to the Liquidity Pool, in addition to that Lenders are going to earn a 2.5% APR yield in a form of $FUSN tokens, protocol’s native governance token. Thanks to lenders, our protocol will have liquidity to supply the borrowers with USDC. In order for borrowers to borrow they will have to collateralize ETH, our protocol works in an over-collateralized model, meaning borrower’s ETH collateral amount > USDC amount they can borrow. Borrow limit is set to 70% of collateral supply. The borrowers pay 3% interest to the protocol in order to maintain it, the interest will be deducted from ETH collateral when the borrower repays the debt. In case of liquidation, meaning when the borrower's ETH collateral amount < USDC borrowed + 10%, our protocol keeps the borrower's ETH collateral and sends the liquidator of the position 1.25% of borrower’s ETH collateral.
